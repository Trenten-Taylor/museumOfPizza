# museumOfPizza
My first project using HTML, CSS, &amp; Bootstrap
The purpose of this project was to get a feel for creating a mock website using bootstrap. 
There is a navigation bar at the top that is responsive and changes into a button based on screen size.
Text and pictures also automatically resize to get smaller and stack.
